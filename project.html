            <h2>ProGrad</h2>
            <p>I am DurrayNayab (try pronouncing, I know it’s difficult). I am doing my graduation. To be precise I am a
                so-called B-Tech student who is not clear with the whole idea called ‘life’. You must thinking that I am
                yet another kid who is studying a degree course under parents’ pressure. However, I am not. My parents
                are more supportive than anyone can imagine. They wanted me to decide for myself. I however have a huge
                number of passions to pursue but I settled for a tech course to be on the safe side.
                Safe side, you see have a twisted meaning on its own, changing from person to person. Some seek refuge
                in fighting for something while others find peace in death. And since most of us work towards decreasing
                the entropy, we tend to settle for a “proved safe side”. We never glance towards the “road not taken”.
                So, hell yeah I took a safe side.
                <span class="break"></span>
                My parents did not object while giving me the power to decide my fate. I was not sure and probably
                flawed my decision. But now when I connect the dots backwards I realize what my parents did for me. They
                taught me a lesson for life that how important it is to take decisions on your own and what is the
                importance of learning to take your decisions.
                Not everyone has the courage to take their own decision. But if you see deep into it, you will realize
                how being able to make decisions make a difference in your life. If not anything else at least, you will
                tend to have less regrets. I do not say that I have zero regrets but I cannot possibly hold someone else
                responsible for my own regrets. It was my doings, circumstantial or not, which has led to where I am
                today and clearly, it were my decisions.
                With each decision I made carved my path till this point. Now when look back and try to imagine about
                things if I would have decided differently, one thing that comes clear is, it wouldn’t have been better.
                I believe there is something called fate but also believes all humans have the power to change the fate.
                That’s how decisions come into picture.
                I am not the correct person to speak about this particular topic. But, India gives us all the freedom of
                speech.
                <span class="break"></span>
                So why waste it???
                <span class="break"></span>
                There are two different kind of decision one can make. One, with all the research and statistics and
                second, with absolute recklessness. The former is type is absolutely stereotype. You think about
                something for days, research about it and if the fog clears, you take a decision. But if you ask my
                personal opinion, go with the latter. That will save you time and the frustration of getting confused.
                Also, when you are deciding this way you will want to gather all your powers to make your decision prove
                right. And the loophole in the former type is after doing all the research, you will be so sure of
                yourself that you wouldn’t want to shift a pebble to catalyze the process (of whatever you are trying to
                do).
                <span class="break"></span>
                Now you must be thinking “how on earth this lady is lecturing us on decision making when she, most
                probably made the wrong one?” . I understand! you can hate me for that. But let’s just say that even I
                am working hard to prove my decision correct. Prove it to myself that I am not the kind of engineer that
                is portrayed by facebook. That happens when you make your own decision.
                When you make your own decision, you want to prove yourself right and work hard for it. And when you
                don’t get a chance of making your own decision, you want to prove it wrong (maybe, unintentionally).
                I think your decisions make you a better person because working hard to get something is never really
                wrong. And I am proud of my parents that they made me learn to take a stand for myself and prove my own
                individuality in a crowd full of stereotypes.
                <span class="break"></span>
                P. S: I don’t know why I named it “Twisted Thoughts”. Probably because I did not realize my parents
                contributed so much more in my life beyond the materialistic help. It all occurred to me during the
                course of writing this piece. So yeah, it was twisted before understanding creep in.
